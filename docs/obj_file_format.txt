.obj file format


each line represents the data it contains

type of data it contains:

v - vertex coord
vt - texture coord
vn - vertex normal
f - face using a series of vertex, texture coordinates and normal data


check models/cube.obj for values and how the data is organised

and more importantly the indexing in the file is 1 based this should be known before hand because i would come handy at
the time of reading the file.
