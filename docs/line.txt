Bresenham's line algorithm

this algorithm is used to draw the line.

start with calculating the distance between x0 and x1 and y0 and y1

now specify the inclination of the line line considering the above values and set the values 1 or -1

err denotes the approximation between the actual line and current point being drawn

use of while loop to terminate at the x1 and y1

now calcualte the error value and set the next point considering the error between the the point actual line and the current point and change the step of x or the y point
