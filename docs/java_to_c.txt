Had this initially in mind what if i want to increase the rendering speed? i would ultimately need to switch to some faster ways of execution. As java being a containered execution in JVM it take plenty of time to heat up the system and get things running. This adds on to the execution time as the project becomes bigger. This being the primary concern i am refactoring this entire project in c.

Changes that are made to the project:
- addons/Converter.java : Removed
    Desc: This file converted .ppm file into .png files.
